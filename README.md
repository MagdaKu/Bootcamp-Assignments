# CFGdegree

## Basic information

Hello my name is Magdalena and I live in Poland. I'm studying Neuroinformatics at the University of Warsaw. My hobbies are:
- sport (for example jogging) 
- movies
- Escape Rooms - solving ridddles gives me a lot of satisfaction :smile:

## Previous CFG projects

I have completed two Kickstarter Courses - _Data & SQL_ and _Python & Apps_. I've also completed the _Git & GitHub_ MOOC Sprint. Right now I'm focusing on CFGdegree and I'm really excited about learning new things.
