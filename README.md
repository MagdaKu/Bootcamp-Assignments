## Description  
This repository was created for a 16-week **"Software or Data Engineer"** bootcamp. Throughout the course, four assignments were completed, each focusing on different aspects of programming and database management.  

### **Assignment 1: Git & GitHub Commands**  
This assignment demonstrates the usage and implementation of GitHub commands, covering essential version control operations.  

### **Assignment 2: Python Quiz Application**  
This is a Python-based quiz that retrieves questions from the **Open Trivia Database**. The user can select a category and answer five **True or False** questions.  

Upon completion, a new file, `quiz_results.txt`, is generated, containing:  
- The quiz questions  
- The user's answers  
- The correct answers  

### **Assignment 3: SQL Database Management**  
This assignment involves working with an SQL database for a **School** system. It includes:  

- A script to create a database with five tables, linked via foreign keys, and populated with mock data.  
- A series of SQL queries that, for example:  
  - Identify students with the highest average grades.  
  - Retrieve email addresses of parents whose children received poor grades.  
  - List students over 18 years old.  
- A **stored procedure** for viewing all students' average grades.  
- An **event trigger** that generates a welcome note for each student at the start of the school year.  

### **Assignment 4: Cinema Reservation System (Flask & MySQL)**  
This project involves developing a database-driven reservation system for a **Cinema** using **Flask** and **MySQL**. Key components include:  

- **`config.py`** – Stores MySQL connection details (`host`, `user`, `password`).  
- **`cinema.sql`** – Creates the database in MySQL.  
- **`db_utils_cinema.py`** – Contains functions for connecting to MySQL and executing queries.  
- **`app_cinema.py` & `main_cinema.py`** – Must run simultaneously:  
  - `app_cinema.py` connects to the server.  
  - `main_cinema.py` provides an interface for customer interactions, handling reservation management.
