Here is the database Cinema and the files that handle adding and deleting reservations. 

Firstly, you should add your configuration data to file config.py, which will be used to connect to MySQL Workbench.
Secondly, you can create the database in MySQL using file cinema.sql
File db_utils_cinema is used to store functions connecting user to MySQL and executing queries.
Then you should start app_cinema.py and main_cinema.py simultaneously. The first file connects to the server, the second is used to interact with the customer. The program enables the customer to book the seats for a movie or delete the reservation.
